This is an Elm web application that shows a guessing game. The game retrieves a random word from a list of 1000 most common English words, and player can try to guess what word it is.

In order to run this game:

1. Install Elm
    
2. Clone this Git repository into your computer and run the following command in the cloned repository:
    
```
elm reactor
```


3. Go to this address: http://localhost:8000 and open Main.elm

In this code source we still leave 2 files Test.elm and Test2.elm which were 2 files where we tested our functions and code. The Main.js file was generated from the Main.elm file, we can use this one and append it to the index.html file and add more CSS to make this application even more beautiful. However, this is not the goal of the project so we didn't do it here.
